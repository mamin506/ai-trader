## Project Management Approach

### Hybrid Approach: Markdown + GitHub Projects

This project uses a **hybrid approach** that combines the strengths of Markdown version control with the visual capabilities of GitHub Projects.

#### **Markdown Files (Primary Source of Truth)**

**Purpose**: Long-term record keeping and architectural decisions

**What Goes Here**:
- ✅ Phase planning and goals
- ✅ Important design decisions
- ✅ Sprint retrospectives and learnings
- ✅ Milestone completion records
- ✅ Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- ✅ Claude Code context (auto-loaded in AI sessions)

**Why Markdown**:
- Git version control tracks all changes
- Works offline, no external dependencies
- Integrates with code repository (atomic commits)
- Always accessible, never vendor-locked
- Developer-friendly (edit in VSCode)

#### **GitHub Projects (Visual Task Management)**

**Purpose**: Day-to-day task tracking and visualization

**What Goes Here**:
- ✅ Sprint backlog and Kanban board
- ✅ Individual task tracking (Issues)
- ✅ Roadmap timeline visualization
- ✅ Automatic PR/commit linkage

**When to Use**:
- When task count exceeds 20-30 items
- When you need visual progress tracking
- When collaborating with others
- When you want deadline reminders

#### **Workflow Integration**

```

#### **Practical Workflow Example**

**Daily Development**:
1. Work on tasks tracked in GitHub Issues
2. Link commits to issues: `git commit -m "feat: implement YFinance (#1)"`
3. Move cards on GitHub Projects board as work progresses

**Weekly Sprint Review**:
1. Review completed issues in GitHub Projects
2. Update `development-plan.md` with Sprint summary:
   ```markdown
   ### 2026-01-24: Sprint 1 Complete ✅
   **Completed**:
   - ✅ YFinance provider (#1)
   - ✅ SQLite database (#2)
   - ✅ DataAPI (#3)

   **Key Learnings**:
   - yfinance API reliability requires retry logic
   - SQLite indexing on (symbol, date) critical for performance
   ```

**Monthly/Phase Milestones**:
1. Comprehensive retrospective in `development-plan.md`
2. Update Phase completion status
3. Archive GitHub Project (optional)

#### **Current Status**

**Phase 1 (Now - Feb 2026)**:
- Using Markdown only (project is early-stage, single developer)
- GitHub Projects deferred until task volume increases

**Future (If Needed)**:
- Will create GitHub Project when task count exceeds 30
- Will maintain both systems with weekly sync
- Markdown remains source of truth for decisions/retrospectives

#### **Alternative Tools Considered**

| Tool | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|------|------|------|----------|
| **Notion** | Rich UI, real-time collaboration | Not version-controlled, requires internet | ❌ Not suitable for solo dev |
| **Linear** | Developer-friendly, GitHub integration | Paid service, learning curve | ❌ Overkill for current needs |
| **GitHub Issues only** | Free, integrated | Heavy for simple tasks | ⚠️ Use for features, not micro-tasks |
| **Markdown only** | Simple, version-controlled | No visual boards | ✅ **Current approach** |
| **Markdown + GitHub Projects** | Best of both worlds | Requires discipline to sync | ✅ **Future approach** |

#### **Decision Rationale**

**Why not Notion/Linear/etc?**
- External tools separate documentation from code
- Claude Code cannot auto-load external project management tools
- Version control is critical for tracking decisions over time
- Offline access is important for development

**Why GitHub Projects as secondary tool?**
- Native integration with code repository
- Free and reliable
- Visual boards help with larger task lists
- Automatically links Issues/PRs/Commits

**Bottom Line**:
- Start simple with Markdown
- Add GitHub Projects when complexity demands it
- Always keep Markdown as source of truth for architecture and decisions

## Progress History

### 2026-01-17: Infrastructure & Data Layer Foundation Completed ✅

**Infrastructure Completed**:
- ✅ Project directory structure (src/, tests/, config/, data/, scripts/, notebooks/)
- ✅ Configuration management (YAML loader with dot-notation access)
- ✅ Logging framework (structured logging with context support)
- ✅ Exception hierarchy (AITraderError and data layer exceptions)
- ✅ YAGNI and KISS principles documented in development guidelines
- ✅ Feature branch workflow with PR requirements established

**Data Layer Completed**:
- ✅ Abstract `DataProvider` interface

2. PR #9: YAGNI and KISS principles documentation
3. PR #10: DataProvider interface
4. PR #11: YFinance provider and DataAPI (pending)

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Used mock-based testing to avoid actual API calls in unit tests
- DataAPI provides both string and datetime date handling for flexibility
- YFinanceProvider standardizes yfinance output to lowercase column names
- All new code follows YAGNI principle (minimal, complete, testable)

**Statistics**:
- 4 PRs created and reviewed
- 6 new modules implemented
- 70 unit tests (99% coverage)
- ~1,200 lines of production code
- ~1,500 lines of test code

### 2026-01-18: Data Layer Enhancement (SQLite & Incremental Fetching) ✅ (by Gemini)
**Completed** (by Google Gemini):
- ✅ `DatabaseManager` implementation (SQLite with `schema.sql`)
- ✅ Smart incremental data fetching in `DataAPI` (fetches only missing data)
- ✅ `view_data.py` CLI improvements (fixed display limit bug)
- ✅ Git workflow improvements (`.gitignore`, feature branching)
- ⚠️ Data validation implementation (too aggressive, caused test failures)

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Implemented `UPSERT` (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE) for efficient data merging
- Normalized timezones to naive UTC-like to prevent pandas merge errors
- `DataAPI` acts as a smart proxy: checks DB first, then Provider, then merges

**Issues Introduced**:
- Validation layer added without corresponding tests
- Broke existing DataAPI tests by changing behavior
- Violated YAGNI principle (added too much at once)
- These issues were fixed on 2026-01-19

### 2026-01-19: Database Caching & Incremental Fetching ✅

**Completed**:
- ✅ Implemented `DatabaseManager` with SQLite backend for local caching
- ✅ Implemented smart incremental fetching in `DataAPI.get_daily_bars()`
  - Checks local database first
  - Fetches only missing data chunks from provider
  - Avoids redundant API calls (bandwidth optimization)
- ✅ Added `get_trading_days()` method to `DataProvider` interface
- ✅ Implemented `YFinanceProvider.get_trading_days()` using `exchange_calendars`
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for `DatabaseManager` (6 tests)
- ✅ Refactored `DataAPI` tests to support caching behavior (10 tests)
- ✅ Fixed all test failures from Gemini's implementation
- ✅ Added `exchange_calendars` dependency to requirements.txt

**Technical Decisions**:
- **Deferred validation layer to Phase 2** (YAGNI principle)
  - Focus on core incremental fetching first
  - Validation adds complexity to tests without immediate value
  - Can be added later as separate layer when needed
- **Database normalization**: All timestamps stored as naive UTC
- **UPSERT strategy**: ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE for efficient merging
- **Test isolation**: Each test uses temporary database file

**Test Results**:
- 78 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Code coverage: 66% (up from 21% during bug fix)
- New tests validate:
  - Database save/load operations
  - Incremental fetching logic
  - Cache hit behavior
  - Date range filtering

**Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed duplicate `__init__` methods in `data_api.py`
- Added missing `Path` import
- Fixed `self.storage` vs `self.db` inconsistency
- Added `get_trading_days()` to `ConcreteDataProvider` test fixture
- Installed `exchange_calendars` package

### 2026-01-18: Data Validation Implemented ✅ (Rolled Back)
**Note**: This implementation was rolled back on 2026-01-19 to follow YAGNI principles.
Validation layer will be re-implemented in Phase 2 after core functionality is stable.

**Original Work** (by Gemini):
- ⚠️ Implemented `DataValidator` (too aggressive, broke tests)
- ⚠️ Integrated validation into `DataAPI` without updating tests
- ⚠️ Added `exchange_calendars` dependency (kept)

### 2026-01-17: Design Phase Completed ✅
**Completed**:
- ✅ All architecture design documents finalized
- ✅ System architecture defined (layered architecture)
- ✅ Technology stack selected (Python, SQLite, TA-Lib, VectorBT, APScheduler)
- ✅ Data layer design (provider abstraction, storage)
- ✅ Strategy layer design (signal semantics, indicator framework)
- ✅ Portfolio management design (allocation algorithms)
- ✅ Risk management design (validation rules, stop-loss)
- ✅ Execution layer design (backtest/paper/live abstraction)
- ✅ User interface design (Python APIs, CLI tools, Jupyter integration)
- ✅ Development guidelines (coding standards, project structure)
- ✅ APScheduler task dependency chain design

**Key Decisions**:
- Scheduler uses task dependency chains to prevent race conditions
- Each layer exposes Python API for interactive debugging and Jupyter use
- Configuration-driven execution mode switching (backtest/paper/live)

### 2026-01-16: Development Environment Setup ✅
**Completed**:
- ✅ VS Code DevContainer configured (Ubuntu 24.04, Python 3.12)
- ✅ Python virtual environment created and activated
- ✅ Black formatter configured (88 char line length)
- ✅ Pylint and mypy setup
- ✅ Git repository initialized

## Risks and Blockers

### Current Risks
1. **Data Quality** (Low Risk - Mitigated)
   - yfinance API may have reliability issues
   - Mitigation: Database caching reduces API dependency, validation deferred to Phase 2

2. **TA-Lib Installation** (Low Risk)
   - TA-Lib C library may be difficult to install on some systems
   - Mitigation: DevContainer ensures consistent environment

3. **Scope Creep** (Low Risk - Controlled)
   - Temptation to add features beyond Phase 1 scope
   - Mitigation: Successfully applied YAGNI principle on 2026-01-19 (deferred validation)

### Current Blockers
- None

### Resolved Blockers
1. **2026-01-19**: Gemini's over-engineered implementation
   - Issue: Added database + validation + incremental fetch all at once without tests
   - Resolution: Rolled back validation layer, kept core incremental fetching
   - Lesson: Follow TDD and YAGNI principles strictly

---

## Retrospectives

### Design Phase Retrospective (2026-01-17)

**What Went Well**:
- Comprehensive design documentation completed
- Clear separation of concerns across layers
- APScheduler task dependency chain designed to prevent race conditions
- User interface layer designed upfront (Python APIs, CLI tools, Jupyter)

**What Could Be Improved**:
- N/A (first retrospective)

**Action Items**:
- Begin Phase 1 implementation with infrastructure setup

---

## Notes and Decisions

### 2026-01-17: Scheduler Task Dependency Design
**Decision**: Use APScheduler with explicit task dependency chains (Data → Signal → Portfolio) to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.

**Rationale**:
- Prevents Strategy Layer from reading stale data
- Clear error handling when tasks fail
- Easy to debug and monitor task execution

**Reference**: See [architecture-overview.md](architecture-overview.md#daily-trading-workflow)
